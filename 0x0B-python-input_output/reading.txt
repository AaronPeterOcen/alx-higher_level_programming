Python Read Data from a File
Let's now come to the real and fun part: operating on the file.

Python provides us with various functions to read from a file. One way to read individual lines from a file without using any function is by using the â€œforâ€ loop.
Code:

>>> f = open("myfile.txt")
>>> for line in f:
        print(line)
